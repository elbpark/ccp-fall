<h1>Roasted Coffee - Furan</h1>
<h2>How is it formed?</h2>
<body>Furan is formed when foods containing constituents such as carbohydrates are thermally degraded through heating during its processing. <br>
For example, this thermal degradation occurs when coffee grounds are roasted, leading to the presence of furan.</body>
