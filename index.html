<h1>Fall 2024 CCP-Chemicals found in everyday foods/h1>
<h2>by Elbert</h2>
<body>For my CCP, I decided to take a closer look at the chemical changes caused by heating, oxidation, and many more processes that lie behind simple foods, creating chemicals with some really weird-sounding names. <br>
My goal through my research was to find a common compound that seemed to be the driving factor of many different food-related chemical changes. <br>
In the end, while there were some exceptions, I did end up finding one thing that seemed to be a reactant in many different chemical changes- amino acids. <br>
I hope you will enjoy discovering some of the many pairs of foods and chemicals formed by said food, and learn something new about chemical changes. </body>
