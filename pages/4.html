<h1>Grilled Burger Patties - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</h1>
<h2>How is it formed?</h2>
<body>When organic materials containing carbon, such as burger patties, are heated directly while being processed (e.g. grilled, pan-seared), PAHs can enter the meat.<br>
PAHs can be carcinogenic (they are able to cause cancer) but the general health risk for someone consuming them in moderation is quite low.</body>
