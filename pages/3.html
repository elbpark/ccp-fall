<h1>Sausages - Nitrosamines</h1>
<h2>How is it formed?</h2>
<body>Nitrites exist within sausages and other cured meats. When these nitrites come together with secondary amines, a nitrogen atom bonded to two groups of atoms containing carbon, nitrosamines are created.<br>
Nitrosamines are potentially harmful to the human body, as they are carcinogenic (can cause cancer) and mutogenic (can mutate genetics.) However, according to the National Library of Medicine, the resulting health risks are very low as long as one consumes foods containing nitrosamines in moderation. </body>
